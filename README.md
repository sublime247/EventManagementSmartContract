# Event Management Contract
==========================

## Overview
--------

This contract provides a decentralized event management system, allowing event managers to create, remove, and manage events, while users can register for events using their NFT tokens.

## Features
--------

* Event creation and removal by authorized event managers
* User registration for events using NFT tokens
* Event tracking and management
* Reentrancy protection and access control

## Functions
------------

### Event Manager Functions

* `createEvent`: Creates a new event with the given details
* `removeEvent`: Removes an existing event by its ID

### User Functions

* `registerForEvent`: Registers a user for an event using their NFT token

## Events
-------

* `EventCreated`: Emitted when a new event is created
* `EventRemoved`: Emitted when an event is removed
* `RegistredSuccessful`: Emitted when a user registers for an event successfully

## Requirements
------------

* Solidity version ^0.8.24
* OpenZeppelin's IERC721 contract for NFT token management

## Installation
------------

To deploy this contract, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn
2. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler
3. Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum network

## Usage
-----

### Event Manager

1. Create a new event using the `createEvent` function
2. Remove an existing event using the `removeEvent` function

### User

1. Register for an event using the `registerForEvent` function

## Security Considerations
-------------------------

* This contract uses reentrancy protection and access control to prevent unauthorized access
* Users must have a valid NFT token to register for an event
* Event managers must be authorized to create and remove events
